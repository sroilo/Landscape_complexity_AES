This repository contains the R scripts necessary to run the models quantifying (landscape-moderated) effects of Agri-Environmental Schemes on the occurrence of the red-backed shrike in three European agricultural regions, Catalonia in Spain, the Mulde River Basin in Germany, and South Moravia in the Czech Republic.

The results of this analysis are presented in the manuscript "A cross-regional analysis of red-backed shrike responses to agri-environmental schemes in Europe" by Roilo S., Spake B., Bullock J. M. and Cord A. F., submitted to Environmental Research Letters. Please acknowledge this manuscript when using the scripts.

The data associatd to this manuscript, and necessary to reproduce the analysis for the region of Catalonia, Spain, are permanently stored in in Zenodo and can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8212013
